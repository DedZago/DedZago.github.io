## SPM.jl [![Build status](https://github.com/DedZago/SPM.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/DedZago/SPM.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/DedZago/SPM.jl/graph/badge.svg?token=F1KFUFLD9A)](https://codecov.io/gh/DedZago/SPM.jl) [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-dev-blue.svg)](https://DedZago.github.io/SPM.jl/dev/)

**SPM.jl** is a comprehensive Julia package for Statistical Process Monitoring, which provides users with tools for monitoring the stability of sequential processes.

This package implements a number of univariate and multivariate control charts, as well as control charts for monitoring partially-observed processes, profiles, and support for multi-chart designs.

Various type of control limits are implemented, with dedicated algorithms for estimating their values based on common metrics such as in-control average run length and in-control run length quantiles.

Hyperparameter tuning is supported via a native grid search implementation, as well as black-box optimization with an interface to the [NLopt](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/NLopt.jl) Julia package.

To install and use the latest release in Julia:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("SPM")
using SPM
```

<!-- As one of my two research agendas involves improving the tools we use to study peace and conflict, a good deal of my time is spent using statistical software. Below you'll find software for working with estimates from Bayesian models and some code that I've written to save time on tasks that I find myself doing over and over again. -->

<!-- I am a developer of the [BayesPostEst](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BayesPostEst) R package for generating postestimation quantities of interest from Bayesian models. The package contains functions for producing regression tables, plotting predicted probabilities, calculating first differences, creating coefficient plots, and many other quantities. You can view the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) article for the package [here](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01722). -->

<!-- I've collected convenience functions that I've written to address issues I frequently confront in my work into a personal R package called [RWmisc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RWmisc). It includes functions for: -->

<!-- - Managing multiple different projections for cross-national spatial data -->
<!-- - Converting latitude-longitude data in archaic forms (degrees, minutes, seconds) -->
<!-- - Correcting for overlapping polygons when aggregating raster data to polygons -->
<!-- - My custom minimal ggplot2 theme -->

<!-- # Other resources -->

<!-- I also have a number of other software resources focused on making computation and academic life easier: -->

<!-- - [The template](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/JobMarket) I use for my academic job market materials -->
<!--     - Fill in school/position information in one file and it populates to all statements -->
<!--     - Generate summary statistics from teaching evaluations and integrate into statements -->
<!--     - Combine multiple teaching evaluations into a single portfolio document -->
<!--     - Do all of this programmatically with GNU Make! -->
<!-- - [The template](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/UNC-Dissertation-Template) I used for my dissertation -->
<!--     - This satisfied the formatting requirements at UNC in 2019 -->
<!--     - Some tweaking likely required to use at another institution or in the future -->
<!-- - [Scripts](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/Teaching) that I use to save time on various teaching-related tasks like grading -->
<!-- - [Functions](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/ComputerVision) for extracting still frames from videos and information from images in Python using OpenCV -->
<!-- - [Compiling OpenCV](/files/html/OpenCV_Install.html) from source for Anaconda virtual environments instead of Homebrew ones or system Python installations -->
