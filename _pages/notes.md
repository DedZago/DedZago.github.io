Here is a collection of notes that I have written during my studies at the [University of Padova](https://www.stat.unipd.it/).
These notes have been taken live using a combination of scripts based on the excellent [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips), [VimTeX](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex), and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) integration available [here](https://castel.dev/).
I combined the available scripts into a note-taking setup, which allows organizing LaTeX notes into themed folder structures, for annotating papers, books, and lectures.
