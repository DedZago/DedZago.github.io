# Research interests
My research area mainly focuses on the development and application of statistical methods to monitor the stability of sequential data.
Specifically, the following topics are my main interests:

- **Statistical process control**: effect of parameter estimation, efficient control limit calculation, control chart tuning, monitoring of partial observations, monitoring of complex data.
- **Numerical analysis**: optimization of stochastic functions, algorithms for doubly-stochastic constrained optimization.
- **Functional data analysis**: analysis and process monitoring of parametric and nonparametric curves.
- **Computational statistics**: algorithm efficiency and flexible code design, solving computational bottlenecks in numerical methods.
