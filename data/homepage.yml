  title: "Who am I?"
  content: >
    <p class="lead">
      I am a statistician that applies data-driven methodologies to develop solutions to solve complex problems. I am a fast learner with the passion of discovering new things.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
      I have pursued a doctoral degree with the aim of deepening my knowledge, and I have experience in statistical consulting as well as software development.
      Most the projects I was involved in required efficient algorithmic solutions, coupled with the development of user interfaces to allow user-friendly applications.<br>

      The things that I look forward the most in a problem are challenges and novel solutions. Because of this, I have worked on a range of different topics, such as <i>3D meshes</i>, <i>stochastic optimization</i>, and <i>efficient algorithms</i>.
