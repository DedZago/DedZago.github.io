      <description>&lt;p&gt;I developed an innovative statistical quality control method for detecting shape defects in complex geometries obtained via additive manufacturing.&#xA;I introduced a novel nonparametric control chart based on kurtosis analysis which provides superior defect detection for 3D-printed objects compared to existing approaches.&#xA;A paper detailing the methodology has been submitted for review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/stochapprox/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I designed a novel stochastic optimization algorithm with stochastic constraints, aimed at optimizing control chart tuning parameters with greater efficiency compared to traditional numerical methods. This innovative approach has been published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Quality Technology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An improved bisection-type algorithm for control chart calibration</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/ba-bisection-control-limit/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/ba-bisection-control-limit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I developed a modified bisection algorithm for computing control limits in complex settings where standard methods are inefficient. The approach removes the need for a predefined search range and scales efficiently to multi-chart scenarios. The method has been published in &lt;em&gt;Statistics and Computing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Monitoring Mixed Data</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/mixed-monitoring/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/mixed-monitoring/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I developed a general methodology to monitor processes involving mixed-type data (continuous, ordinal, categorical), common in real-world applications. The method enables effective sequential monitoring under serial correlation and has been published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Quality Technology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A software for modern statistical process monitoring</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/package-spm/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/package-spm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I developed a Julia package for real-time statistical process monitoring, integrating advanced algorithms and control charts to handle complex data types, such as sequential data, functional data, and structured observations. A paper illustrating package has been published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Statistical Software&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Alternative parameter learning schemes for monitoring process stability</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/alternative-parameter-learning/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/alternative-parameter-learning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I formalized the theoretical behavior of parameter learning schemes in relation to outlier detection performance in control charts. This work enabled the generalization of alternative parameter learning methods, leading to a more efficient and accurate detection scheme compared to traditional approaches.&#xA;This work has been published in &lt;em&gt;Quality Engineering&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
