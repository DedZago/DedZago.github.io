I developed an innovative statistical quality control method for detecting shape defects in complex geometries obtained via additive manufacturing.
I introduced a novel nonparametric control chart based on kurtosis analysis which provides superior defect detection for 3D-printed objects compared to existing approaches.
A paper detailing the methodology has been submitted for review.
