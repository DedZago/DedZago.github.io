I developed a general methodology to monitor processes involving mixed-type data (continuous, ordinal, categorical), common in real-world applications. By transforming and decorrelating the data, the method enables effective sequential monitoringâ€”even under serial correlation. This approach is shown to outperform several state-of-the-art techniques and has been published in the *Journal of Quality Technology*.
