I formalized the theoretical behavior of parameter learning schemes in relation to outlier detection performance in control charts. This work enabled the generalization of alternative parameter learning methods, leading to a more efficient and accurate detection scheme compared to traditional approaches.
This work has been published in *Quality Engineering*.
