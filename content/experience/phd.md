### Ph.D. Student in Statistical Sciences

During my Ph.D. in Statistical Sciences at Università degli Studi di Padova, I focused on advancing my technical expertise in industrial statistics, particularly in real-time outlier detection and stochastic optimization. My work in these areas has been recognized through multiple publications in leading journals, such as *Journal of Quality Technology* and *Quality Engineering*.
Furthermore, I developed a statistical package in **Julia**, which has been published as an article in the *Journal of Statistical Software*.

Additionally, I applied my knowledge in real-world contexts, taking part in several consulting projects. In one notable project, I designed a state-of-the-art monitoring system for detecting structural anomalies using vibrating rope strain gauges sensor data. This system outperformed the previous monitoring system in efficiency and accuracy of the detection.

I submitted my thesis in 2024, titled "*Advanced Statistical Process Monitoring using Simulation-Based Algorithms*."
