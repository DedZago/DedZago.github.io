### Ph.D. Student in Statistical Sciences

During my Ph.D. in Statistical Sciences at Università degli Studi di Padova, I focused on advancing my technical expertise in industrial statistics, particularly in real-time outlier detection and stochastic optimization. My research contributions have resulted in publications in several journals, such as the *Journal of Quality Technology*, *Statistics & Computing*, *Quality Engineering*, and the *Journal of Statistical Software*.

Additionally, I applied my knowledge in real-world contexts, taking part in consulting projects related to statistical process monitoring.

I submitted my thesis in 2024, titled "*Advanced Statistical Process Monitoring using Simulation-Based Algorithms*."
