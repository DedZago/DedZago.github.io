### Data Scientist at OPTIT S.r.l.

I joined OPTIT S.r.l. as a Data Scientist to leverage my statistical expertise in solving complex, real-world problems. Part of my workload has focused on implementing data-driven solutions for energy forecasting and anomaly detection. The remaining part was dedicated to research and development on novel algorithms for the periodic multiple vehicle routing problem, both in single- as well as in multi-frequency pickup pattenrs.
